# Hello, world

This repository is for practicing python.

I like to work with data. I am interested in econometrics and machine learning.

I would like to replicate econometric techniques using python.

I am also studying PyTorch and TensorFlow. I try to better understand these libraries by replicating their results using NumPy.
